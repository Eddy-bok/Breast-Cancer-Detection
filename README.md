# Breast Cancer Classification with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project explores the use of machine learning to classify breast cancer cases as benign or malignant. It includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and some unsupervised analysis.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need:

- Python 3.10 or later
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- tensorflow
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Dataset
- File: `BreastCancer_Screening.csv`

## How to Run

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Start Jupyter Notebook by typing:
3. In the browser window that opens, run your notebooks in this order:
- `Final Project.ipynb`

## Reproducibility

- All models use `random_state=42` to ensure consistent results across runs.
- Evaluation metrics and plots (like learning curves and confusion matrices) will match the report if notebooks are run in order.
- The dataset used is consistent and included in the project folder.
